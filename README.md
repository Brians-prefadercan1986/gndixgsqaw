Just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Control Freak, and man, what a trip that was. You’ve seen it? It's like they took a regular day and cranked up the chaos meter to max. I’m telling you, by the end, I was like, “Dude, I drive a bus, and even I don’t have that much stress day-to-day!” 😂 Seriously, though, the main character... What a rollercoaster. He’s living in this insane world where literally everything needs to be controlled, and meanwhile, I’m just trying to keep my passengers from getting mad when I’m a minute late. Kind of puts my job in perspective, you know?

The visuals were pretty wild, though. It was like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 someone else’s panic attack unfold on screen, but in a good way, if that's even possible. I kept thinking, “Could I do that?” Nah. I’d probably just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   again to prove to myself I’m not dreaming. I mean, the guy was kind of a mess, but in a brilliant way. At one point, I was like, “Is this dude going to implode under his own thoughts?” Haha, same, bro, but for way less intense reasons, like making sure my bus stops at the right spot...

> The soundtrack, though, wow! It felt like it was messing with my heartbeat or something. Or maybe that's just because I was too into the   and skipped dinner (oops). So there I am, munching on stale chips, half in a stupor, thinking about how I should’ve just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 the   later. Or maybe I was just hungry. Who knows anymore?

> Anyway, what’s with all the techy stuff they threw in there? Like, I half expected the guy to just whip out a keyboard and start 𝘩𝘢𝘤𝘬ing reality. Imagine if I did that on my bus. Pfft, no, thanks, I prefer my chaos a bit more ordinary.

console.log(Am I a coder now?);

Honestly, I feel like I need a nap just from 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 that. Speaking of which, I probably should catch some Z's. Early start tomorrow, you know how it is. But, hey, if you get a chance, check out Control Freak. Or if you’re feeling brave, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . Might make your day seem a whole lot smoother in comparison. Catch you later, man!
